## Front-End <-> Back-End communication - List of APIs
### 1. Register
Create a register form and send an object to the respective API via `POST` request, object accepted:
````
{
    "name": "name"
    "email": "email"
    "password": "password"
}
````
The previous object needs to be send to the `${BACKEND_HOST}/user/register` path and it will be parsed and accepted if authentication passes. When requesting to the API, a message will be send with a `400 code` if there's a problem related to the parameters send via body on the POST request or a `500 code` if there was an error on the request itself. If register was succesful a `Registration success. Activate your account accessing your email.` message is sent within the response, also a confirmation email is sent to the new user's email where it contains a URL `${FRONTEND_HOST}/user/activate/${activation_token}` with an activation token as a `http` parameter that is available for 10 minutes and it contains user information, when accessed this URL the registration is successful.

---

### 2. Activate Email
Create an endpoint for `${FRONTEND_HOST}/user/activate/${activation_token}`(this is gonna be accessed from the email) where **activation_token** can be taken as a parameter, after getting the **activation_token** send an object to the respective API via `POST` request, object accepted:
````
{
    "activation_token": "activation_token"
}
````
The previous object needs to be send to the `${BACKEND_HOST}/user/activation` path and it will be parsed and accepted if authentication passes. When requesting to the API, a message will be send a `500 code` if there was an error on the request itself. Then the token is verified, if verification was succesful the user is saved correctly on the database and an  `Account has been activated.` message is sent within the response.

---

### 3. Login
Create a login form and send an object to the respective API via `POST` request, object accepted:
````
{
    "email": "email"
    "password": password"
}
````
The previous object needs to be send to the `${BACKEND_HOST}/user/login` path and it will be parsed and accepted if authentication passes. When requesting to the API, a message will be send with a `400 code` if there's a problem related to the parameters send via body on the POST request or a `500 code` if there was an error on the request itself. If login was succesful a `Login success` message is sent within the response, also a cookie with a refresh_token of seven days is passed to the `${BACKEND_HOST}/user/refresh_token` path.

---

### 4. Access Token
After login a cookie with a refresh_token of seven days is passed to the `${BACKEND_HOST}/user/refresh_token`, a request to the respective API via `POST` must be performed in order to get the cookie and then store on the browser (this action is recommended to do it every time there is a login from any user), the API will get an object like this one:
````
{
    "refresh_token": "refreshtoken"
}
````
After hitting the `${BACKEND_HOST}/user/refresh_token` endpoint the response will get the refresh token from the cookie created when logging in and this token can be stored on the browser.

---

### 5. Forgot Password
If password forgot when loggin in, send an object to the respective API via `POST` request, object accepted:
````
{
    "email": "email"
}
````
The previous object needs to be send to the `${BACKEND_HOST}/user/forgot_pwd` path and it will be parsed and accepted if authentication passes. When requesting to the API, a message will be send with a `400 code` if there's a problem related to the parameters send via body on the POST request or a `500 code` if there was an error on the request itself. If authentication was succesful a `Reset password, check your email` message is sent within the response, also a confirmation email is sent to the user's email where it contains a URL `${FRONTEND_HOST}/user/reset/${access_token}` with an activation token as a `http` parameter and it contains user information, when accessed this URL the Front-End must show a new form from its end.

---

### 6. Reset Password
Create an endpoint for `${FRONTEND_HOST}/user/reset/${access_token}`(this is gonna be accessed from the email when password is forgotten) where **access_token** can be taken as a parameter, after getting the **access_token** send an object to the respective API via `POST` request and also an authentication header must be send with the token taken from the http parameters, object accepted:
````
{
    "password": "newpassword"
}
````
The previous object needs to be send to the `${BACKEND_HOST}/user/reset_pwd` path and it will be parsed and accepted if authentication passes. Before this, the previous object will only be send if token(http parameter) send from the Front-End is not expired and nothing happens during authentication in this case the token provides the user that it's sending the request, if there was a problem with authentication a `400 code` will be sent and also a `Invalid authentication` message. When requesting to the API, a message will be send a `500 code` if there was an error on the request itself. Then the password will be saved and a `Password changed` message is sent within the response.

---

### 7. Logout
Create a logout button and send a `POST` request to the respective API. This request will simply clear the cookie that is stored on the `${BACKEND_HOST}/user/refresh_token`. When requesting to the API, a message will be send with a `500 code` if there was an error on the request itself. If logout was succesful a `Logged out.` message is sent within the response.

---

### 8. Get User Information
This API gives the current user information, it will receive an `access_token` stored in the browser and will authenticate it, if authentication passes, you will get an object with user information. To call this API the `${BACKEND_HOST}/user/user_info` should be hit as a `GET` request with the `access_token` as a header for the request, the object returned by the request will have this structure:
````
{
    "user": {
        "_id": "id",
        "name": "name",
        "email": "email",
        "role": role,
        "avatar": "avatar",
        "createdAt": "createdAt",
        "updatedAt": "updatedAt",
        "__v": 0
    }
}
````
The previous object will only be send if token send from the Front-End is not expired and nothing happens during authentication, if there was a problem with authentication a `400 code` will be sent and also a `Invalid authentication` message.

---

### 9. Get ALL Users Information
This API gives all users information, it will receive an `access_token` stored in the browser and will authenticate it, if authentication passes, you will get an object with all users information. To call this API the `${BACKEND_HOST}/user/user_info` should be hit as a `GET` request with the `access_token` as a header for the request, the object returned by the request will have this structure:
````
[
    {
        "_id": "id",
        "name": "name",
        "email": "email",
        "role": role,
        "avatar": "avatar",
        "createdAt": "createdAt",
        "updatedAt": "updatedAt",
        "__v": 0
    },
    {
        "_id": "id",
        "name": "name",
        "email": "email",
        "role": role,
        "avatar": "avatar",
        "createdAt": "createdAt",
        "updatedAt": "updatedAt",
        "__v": 0
    }
]
````
The previous object will only be send if token send from the Front-End is not expired and nothing happens during authentication in this case the token provides the role of administrator, if user `is administrator` the request will be performed successfully, if there was a problem with authentication a `400 code` will be sent and also a `Invalid authentication` message.
